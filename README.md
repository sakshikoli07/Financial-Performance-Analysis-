# Financial-Performance-Analysis (Excel Project)

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a retail sales dataset using Microsoft Excel and building an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders understand key business metrics such as:
- Sales performance
- Gross profit trends
- Top product analysis
- Regional category insights

The dashboard makes it easy for users to filter by time (Month/Year) and see weekly/monthly/category-based insights at a glance.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often face challenges in analyzing their large sales datasets. Without visual insights or summaries:
- Performance tracking becomes difficult
- Top/bottom categories go unnoticed
- Trends in sales/profit over time are unclear

This project solves that by creating a centralized Excel workbook with data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, and a user-friendly dashboard.
